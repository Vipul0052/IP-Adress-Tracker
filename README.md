## Overview

### The challenge

Discover the location, timezone, and ISP of any IP address with the IP Address Tracker! 

This webpage allows users to
- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Find their own IP address on the map on the initial page load. 
Users can also search for any IP addresses or domains and see the key information and location.

### How to setup the project

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using GitHub Desktop or Git Bash:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vipul0052/IP-Adress-Tracker.git
    ```
2. Open the project folder in your code editor.
3. Run the project using a live server extension or deploy it using Netlify, Vercel, or another web hosting and deployment service.
